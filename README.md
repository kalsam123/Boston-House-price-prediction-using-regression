# Boston-House-price-prediction-using-regression
This is a Applied Machine learning project on Predicting House prices,using Boston housing dataset .

The folder 'notebooks' contains files linearRegression.ipynb , pymachineproject.ipynb ,RandomForrestRegressor.ipynb.

These Jupyter Notebook files,contain the entire code that is required,for training,evaluating and finally testing the machine learning models "linear regression","XGBoost
regression","Randomforrest regression" respectively on the boston housing dataset,after Preprocesng it.

The File app.py contains the code ,for running the Web API of the final model ('XGBoost regression'),choosen after Model evaluation.

Running the web app:

Download all the files in the repository.Transfer these files('app.py','templates','static','Xgb.pkl') to your python directory.
Run the file app.py in the python command line .Finallly,the web application runs on your localhost,on your default web browser.
