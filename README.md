# Boston-House-price-prediction-using-regression
A machine learning web app for house price prediction.
The folder 'notebooks' contains files linearRegression.ipynb , pymachineproject.ipynb ,RandomForrestRegressor.ipynb.
These files contain the entire project code that i have implemented for the machine learning models linear regression,Xgboost regression,Randomforrest regression trained on the boston dataset respectively.
app.py is the code for running the Web API of the final model.
